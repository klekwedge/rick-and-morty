## My process

### Built with

- React
- Next
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- SCSS


### What I learned

I learned how to send requests to the API, receive a response from the server and process it, display the received data on the pages. I made a multi-page application (SPA), I understood how the Next works, in particular, the server side rendering and routing. I learned how to better type the received data using TypeScript, work with services.
